-- HAVING vs WHERE
-- use HAVING after GROUP BY since it must execute first

SELECT gender, AVG(age)
FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_demographics
GROUP BY gender
HAVING AVG(age) < 40
;

SELECT occupation, AVG(salary)
FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_salary
WHERE occupation LIKE '%manager%'
GROUP BY occupation
HAVING AVG(salary) > 75000
;
